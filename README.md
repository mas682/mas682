## About Me

My name is Matt Stropkey. I have a Computer Science degree from the University of Pittsburgh and currently work as a Site Reliability Engineer at Indeed. I am passionate about building and maintaining robust, scalable systems and enjoy coding in Python. I am relatively new to the tech industry (<10 years) and continuously seek new challenges and learning opportunities. This is my personal GitHub with various projects dating back to my college days.  These days I mostly use my GitHub to learn how to use new languages and tools. I plan to continue building up my GitHub as I come up with new challenges to solve and hopefully new projects to collaborate on. Feel free to check out any of my repositories.

## Work Experience

**Indeed:**

*Site Reliability Engineer I* (April 2022 - July 2023)  
*Site Reliability Engineer II* (July 2023 - Present)

At Indeed, I have developed tools to assess and enhance service maturity, decommission unused services, and migrate high-traffic domains to improve bot detection. My work involves using technologies like Python, Flask, Terraform, and React, and setting up monitors and SLOs using Datadog and PagerDuty. I also create onboarding documentation to streamline the integration of new SREs.

**PNC Bank:**

*Software Developer Associate* (January 2020 - September 2021)  
*Software Developer (Site Reliability Center)* (September 2021 - April 2022)

At PNC Bank, I created scalable ETL processes, developed near real-time reporting systems, and automated secure credential rotation. For example, one challenging project involved creating a near real-time report showing environment changes and related events/issues. This utilized PowerShell for ETL processes and SQL and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for the reports. Additionally, I automated tasks such as running commands on routers via Python to enhance data during issues.

## Key Technical Skills

**Languages:**  
HTML, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, SQL, Terraform

**Frameworks and Libraries:**  
Express, Flask, Node.js, React

**Tools:**  
AWS, Cloudflare, Confluence, Cron, Datadog, Docker, Figma, Flyway, GitHub, GitLab, Grafana, Jira, Kubernetes, Linux, MSSQL, NS1, PagerDuty, PostgreSQL, Redis, SQL Server Reporting Services

## Contact

If you have any questions or want to reach out, feel free to contact me at [mas682@pitt.edu](mailto:mas682@pitt.edu) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-stropkey). I welcome constructive feedback on my work and look forward to collaborating with other developers on their projects. Thanks for visiting my GitHub!

## Note

I uploaded most of my school projects at once, as I previously had them in private repositories to prevent current students from easily finding and reusing them.
