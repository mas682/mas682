## About Me
My name is Matt Stropkey.  I have a computer science degree from the University of Pittsburgh and I am currently a software developer with PNC Bank.  I am relatively new to the tech industry (<10 years) so I still have a lot of exploring that I am currently doing.  I tend to come across ideas randomly or run into some new challenge that causes me to want to learn more about how to solve it.  This is my personal GitHub with various projects dating back to some of my first projects in college.  I am planning on continuing to add to my GitHub as I come up with new challenges to solve and hopefully new projects to collaberate on.  My most recent project is the [React-Movie-App](https://github.com/mas682/React-Movie-App) repository which I have been working on for quiet some time.  The project itself encompasses a majority of all the things I have learned over the years from building a database, networking, cybersecurity, and more.  Feel free to check out that repository or any of my other repositories.

## Work
- **PNC Bank:** built a lot of reports related for the site reliablilty center to give insights into various things going on in the environment

## Contact 
If you have any questions or want to contact me, feel free to reach out to me at mas682@pitt.edu or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-stropkey-884b417a/).  I would love to get back some constructive feedback on anything I've worked on as well as collaberate with other developers on projects they are working on.  Thanks for taking a look around!
